=Bitcoin Command Line=
==Tools==
First, you will need to install the bitcion client on your machine.  Directions for doing so can be found for the different operating systems in the links below.  Once you have validated that you have appropriately installed bitcoin, please proceed to the directions for configuring your installation to work with the test net before syncing. <br /><br />

MacOS<br />

==Configuration==

Operating System	Default bitcoin datadir	Typical path to configuration file
Windows	 %APPDATA%\Bitcoin\	C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf
Linux	$HOME/.bitcoin/	/home/username/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
Mac OSX	$HOME/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/	/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf

Configure to run on the testnet
<source lang="bash">
testnet=1
rpcport=18332
</source>

Add aliases
MacOS

cat >> ~/.bash_profile <<EOF
alias btcdir="cd ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin" #MacOS default bitcoind path
alias bc="~/bitcoin/src/bitcoin-cli"
alias bd="~/bitcoin/src/bitcoind"
alias btcinfo='bc getwalletinfo | egrep "\"balance\""; bc getnetworkinfo | egrep "\"version\"|connections"; bc getmininginfo | egrep "\"blocks\"|errors"'
EOF

Linux
cat >> ~/.bash_profile <<EOF
alias btcdir="cd ~/.bitcoin/" #linux default bitcoind path
alias bc="bitcoin-cli"
alias bd="bitcoind"
alias btcinfo='bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo | egrep "\"balance\""; bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | egrep "\"version\"|connections"; bitcoin-cli getmininginfo | egrep "\"blocks\"|errors"'
EOF

Reload .bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

Start bitcoind
bd

Monitor bitcoind in a new tab
tail -f $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log

Generate a wallet

Now that you have a wallet, you will need to get an address from your wallet.  The wallet in this case is a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet which you can find out more about by reading Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 32 https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki . All bips proposed and implemented can be viewed at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips.  These are often the best source of information when trying to learn about or understand a feature of Bitcoin without having to read the source code. 

A HD wallet is a set of addresses which is generated from a single master seed using a hierarchical deterministic process.  So a wallet can have many types of coins, such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Testnet, Litecoin, et cetera.  A wallet has many ddresses with different uses such as external or change. A wallet can also organize the addresses for a specific coin type into accounts.  Where the account will have many addresses for that coin type.  This may all seem confusing but you can learn more at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki.  But simply for now you can think of wallets as having many addresses.

Before we can use our newly generated wallet, we will need to get an address from our wallet.

Check Transaction Status
https://live.blockcypher.com/

Select "Bitcoin Testnet" in the search menu and enter your Bitcoin address

You should see a test faucet transaction sending money to your wallet.  If not, wait for a few minutes and refresh.  The reason that you will potentially need to wait is that you transaction must be included in a block.  Bitcoin blocks are found using a stochastic process of mining where blocks are typically found every 10 minutes.  There can be a significant deviation in any given block time ranging from 1 minute to 60 minutes is not atypical. To check on the progress of the Bitcoin testnet blocks you can go to https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/ and see when the last block was found.

Once you see the transaction on the testnet, go back to the command line and enter

```BASH
bc getwalletinfo
```

you should see a result similar to the following:

```BASH
{
  "walletname": "wallet.dat",
  "walletversion": 159900,
  "balance": 0.08203474,
  "unconfirmed_balance": 0.00000000,
  "immature_balance": 0.00000000,
  "txcount": 1,
  "keypoololdest": 1547959045,
  "keypoolsize": 999,
  "keypoolsize_hd_internal": 1000,
  "paytxfee": 0.00000000,
  "hdmasterkeyid": "3aee71d488da5d8547e22087f7d577136d7f4a80"
}
```

Now that you have testnet bitcoins it is time for you to try and sign and send a transaction
