# Assignment
This is assignment is structured to help you become familiar with smart contracts and how they work, specifically on the Ethereum blockchain.  Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, uses accounts rather than UTXOs.  Additionally, it has a more flexible Turing complete programming language.  Most importantly it has a much more developed set of tools that can be leveraged for smart contract and application development. You will use the Truffle suite in this assignment to create and deploy a smart contract as well as simple use interface. Through out this excercise there will be a number of ***Assignment Deliverable XX:*** . This will tell you what you need to turn in at the end of the assignment.  If there are more than one items required for that deliverable add a blank line between them. The format of the submitted work should be a text file with you name, date, assignment name, and UT ID. There should be sections of indicated by Assignment Deliverable XX: followed by the deliverable information.  For example:

Karl, Kreder            01/25/2019             Intro_to_Bitcoin_Command_Line            UTID

Hello, Bitcoin

Assignment Deliverable 2:

# Tools
First, you will need to install the truffle suite.  Truffle suite will require you to first install git as well as npm.  Once you have validated that you have appropriately installed these dependencies, please proceed to the pet-shop tutorial which will cover truffle installation. <br><br>

# PetShop Tutorial
Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has well maintained up-to-date tools and tutorials which help to make my life easier.  The Petshop tutorial will teach you how to write a smart contract, use ganache to create a private ethereum instance, deploy a smart contract, and use a web3 interface to interact with your application.  The Pet tutorial can be found here: <br><br>

<br><br>
As you are working through the petshop tutorial keep in mind the deliverables which you will need to turn in below.

## Connecting to Infura
Infura is a service which provides a RESTful interface to the Ethereum blockchain.  Once you have run through the petshop tutorial successfully, move your application from your blockchain to the Ropstien testnet.

Once you have moved to the Ropstein testnet, you will need to get some testnet ethereum which can be found here:

https://faucet.ropsten.be/

or here:

https://faucet.metamask.io/

Once you have some Ether deploy your contract to the Ropsten testnet and answer the deliverables.

***Assignment Deliverable 1:*** Deploy your contracts to the testnet.  Provide the contract ID.

***Assignment Deliverable 2:*** Create a second account in your Metamask wallet and adopt a pet.  Provide a TX ID.
